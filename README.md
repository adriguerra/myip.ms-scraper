<h3>IDEA Generation</h3>
<p>As the SEO person requires the details about shop website ,Ip,ratings and etc</p>
<p>As the data was in large quantity around 300k lines so copy pasting is not a valid option so to over come this difficulty there was this project idea</p>
<h3>Approch to problem</h3>
<p>After the idea generation now the main part comes how to get motivation to write code </P>
<p>After watching some HENT4I i got bit motivated And started analiziing the website tags and sorted all the tags imp to our scrapping </P>
<p>After that the task was easy some for loop and we are done coding UWU</p>
<h3>Solution<h3>
<p>As now we can scrape the data as per our will if we want data of specific page we can do that or we can go with process of getting the range of page number we want ot scrape</p>
<p>this saves a lot of time and efforts of copy pasting</P>
